# TITLE
EUREKA LABS IS TAKING SCHOOL TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company:
Eureka Labs

* When was the company incorporated?
The San Francisco-based company regeistered as an LLC on June 24, 2024.(1)

* Who are the founders of the company?
Alexej Karpathy - former head of AI at Tesla and AI researcher at OpenAI.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
The idea behind Eureka Labs is to bring very high-level teaching to everyone. In an example Mr. Karpathy gave in his post announcing the project: 

        "...in the case of physics one could imagine working through very high-quality course materials together with [Richard] Feynman, who is there to guide you every step of the way. Unfortunately, subject matter experts who are deeply passionate, great at teaching, infinitely patient and fluent in all of the world's languages are also very scarce and cannot personally tutor all 8 billion of us on demand.".(2)

* The foundation is to be able to teach anything to anyone.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Eureka Labs appears to be self-funded but there is no disclosure on the amount used for startup.


## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Although there are many field experts for all sciences, businesses, etc..., there aren't ample high-level experts to teach the growing population of the earth. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer for Eureka Labs is anyone who seriously wants to learn about anything and have the necessary guidance to do so. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Eureka Labs has a market niche that is not yet occupied by any other notable company. According to Karpathy, the course materials will still be built and designed by teachers, but they could be assisted by the Eureka Labs AI asssistant. Although the idea is still in early phases of testing, studies have found that the use of AI assistants have improved students' grades.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Eureka Labs is using LLM (Large Lannguage Models) that can recognize and generate text. AI-powered teaching, based on LLMs is being used to create customized content and guidance to students. The flagship class given by Eureka Labs is LLM101n, which teaches students how to create their own LLMs.
Eureka Labs also uses AI-integrated cirriculum that is designed by experts, then incorporated to create and AI-native experience. Combining the two has aims to make high-quality education available and more personalized.
AI-assisted guidance is provided by Eureka Labs in order to help efficiently and accurately navigate content and support, as if they're learning directly from the field expert.

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
Education

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Personalized learning - AI can form educational content to fit the needs of the student.
Intelligent tutoring systems - These systems can use AI to provide real-time feedback to students as if they're getting personalized tutoring.
Automated administration - AI can assist with automating grading systems, scheduling, etc..., thereby liberating educators from very time-intensive tasks.

Teachmint - India
Udacity - USA
Memrise - United Kingdom

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
ALthough Eureka Labs is still in its infancy, its largest impact has been its education model that has human teachers form the course materials which AI teaching assistants guide students through their educational experience. This model makes high-level education more available(4).

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
Student engagement and retention - Although still new, Eureka Labs seems to accell with good ratings by clients and partners

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) While developing their product, I would advise that the create oitne with a large emphasis on ethical AI.


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? With focus on ethical AI, it would address privacy, transparency, partiality and other issues.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? Federated Learning, Explainable AI, and Differential Privacy are just a few technologies that would be utilized to incorporate ethical AI into cirriculum.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? Federated Learning can help keep data decentralized and allows training on local data, thus increasing security of that data. Explainable AI can increase trust in their models using developmental transparency to explain the decision processes behind them. Differential Privacy can dafeguard data privacy while allowing purposeful insight to be brought forward from data analysis.(6)
